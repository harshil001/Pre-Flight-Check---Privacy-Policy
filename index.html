    <p>Privacy Policy for OTT Visualizer
        
1. Introduction
OTT Visualizer is a Google Chrome Extension designed to assist Quality Assurance (QA) and Content Operations teams in validating metadata for Over-The-Top (OTT) streaming devices. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your data.
This Privacy Policy describes how OTT Visualizer accesses, uses, and protects user data obtained through Google APIs, specifically Google Drive and Google Sheets.
2. Data Collection and Usage
OTT Visualizer does not collect, store, or transfer user data to any external or third-party servers. All data processing is performed locally within the user's browser instance.
Google User Data: We access your Google Account email address (identity scope) solely to authenticate your session via Google OAuth 2.0. This ensures that the extension acts on behalf of the authorized user.
Google Drive Files: We use the drive.readonly scope strictly to populate the Google Picker interface. This allows you to browse and select the specific spreadsheet you wish to analyze. We do not scan, download, or store your file library.
Google Sheets Data: We use the spreadsheets scope to:
Read: Fetch text strings from the user-designated columns in your active spreadsheet.
Write: Insert "PASS/FAIL" verdicts and apply conditional color formatting (Green/Red) directly back into your spreadsheet.
We do not use this data for advertising, market research, or any purpose other than the specific functionality of the extension described above.
3. Data Protection Mechanisms
We employ strict security measures to protect your information:
Client-Side Processing: The logic for analyzing text width and device constraints runs entirely in JavaScript on your local machine. Your spreadsheet content is never sent to our servers because we do not have servers.
HTTPS Encryption: All communication between the extension and Google's APIs (Drive and Sheets) occurs over secure, encrypted HTTPS channels (TLS 1.2+).
Sandboxing: The file selection interface uses a sandboxed iframe (picker_sandbox.html) to isolate the Google Picker API, preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
4. Data Retention Policy
OTT Visualizer operates on a zero-retention basis:
Transient Access: Data read from your spreadsheet is held in your browser's volatile memory (RAM) only for the duration of the "Run Diagnostic" execution.
No Persistence: Once the browser window is closed or the diagnostic run is complete, all fetched data is immediately discarded. We do not maintain any databases or logs of your content.
5. Data Sharing and Third Parties
We do not share, sell, or disclose your data to any third parties.
The extension interacts directly with Google APIs. Google’s handling of your data is governed by the Google Privacy Policy.
6. Limited Use Disclosure
OTT Visualizer's use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.
7. Contact Information

    <h3>Data Protection Mechanisms</h3>
<p>
    OTT Visualizer employs industry-standard security measures to ensure the safety of your data.
    All data transmission between the application and Google's servers occurs over secure, encrypted protocols (HTTPS/TLS).
    We do not store your Google credentials or access tokens on our servers; they are maintained securely within your browser's local storage or the session state.
</p>

<h3>Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Retention:</strong> We do not retain or store your user data (such as spreadsheet content or checklist items) on our servers. Data is accessed in real-time solely for the purpose of generating the visualization or checklist and is processed temporarily in memory.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Deletion:</strong> Since we do not store your data, there is no need for a deletion request mechanism. Once you close the application or the browser tab, any temporary data processed by the application is immediately discarded.
