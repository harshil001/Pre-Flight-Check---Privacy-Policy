    <p>Privacy Policy for Pre Flight Check
        
1. Introduction
"Pre Flight Check" (the "Extension") is a productivity tool designed to help users validate text length within Google Sheets against specific device constraints. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This policy explains how we handle your data.

2. Data We Collect
The Extension interacts with your Google Sheets data solely at your request.
Sheet Data: When you click "Run Diagnostics," the Extension reads the text in the specific column you select in your active Google Sheet.
Authentication: We use chrome.identity to request an OAuth2 token from Google. This token is used strictly to authenticate API calls to the Google Sheets API on your behalf.
        
3. How We Use Your Data
Validation: The text data retrieved from your Sheet is processed locally within your browser to calculate pixel width and line counts.
Writing Results: The Extension writes "Pass/Fail" verdicts and formatting (color highlights) back to your Google Sheet.
No External Transfer: We do not send your spreadsheet data, text, or authentication tokens to any external servers, databases, or third-party analytics services. All processing happens between your browser and Google's official APIs.

4. Data Storage
The Extension saves your preference settings (like the last used "Device Profile") locally in your Chrome browser using chrome.storage.local. This data never leaves your device.
        
5. Third-Party Services
The Extension relies on the Google Sheets API. Usage of that data is subject to Google's Privacy Policy.
        
6. Contact: If you have questions about this policy, please contact the developer via the support link on the Chrome Web Store listing.

    <h3>Data Protection Mechanisms</h3>
<p>
    Harshil Visualizer employs industry-standard security measures to ensure the safety of your data.
    All data transmission between the application and Google's servers occurs over secure, encrypted protocols (HTTPS/TLS).
    We do not store your Google credentials or access tokens on our servers; they are maintained securely within your browser's local storage or the session state.
</p>

<h3>Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Retention:</strong> We do not retain or store your user data (such as spreadsheet content or checklist items) on our servers. Data is accessed in real-time solely for the purpose of generating the visualization or checklist and is processed temporarily in memory.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Deletion:</strong> Since we do not store your data, there is no need for a deletion request mechanism. Once you close the application or the browser tab, any temporary data processed by the application is immediately discarded.
