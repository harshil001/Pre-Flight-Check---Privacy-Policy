    <h3>About the App</h3>
    <p>
        OTT is a professional quality assurance utility designed for Operations and Supply Chain Engineers. It eliminates costly metadata rejections by simulating how your content descriptions will render on end-user hardware before they are submitted. Stop guessing if your headlines, subtitles, or ad copy will get cut off. This extension greatly helps content creators, distributors, marketers, and operations teams to ensure their text fits perfectly on any screen before it goes live.

    <h3>How it Works</h3>
    <p>
        THE PROBLEM:

OTT Visualizer is a productivity tool designed for QA and Content Operations teams who manage metadata for streaming platforms.

Manually checking if movie titles and descriptions fit within the UI constraints of different devices (Apple TV, Roku, Fire TV, etc.) is error-prone and tedious. OTT Visualizer automates this process directly within Google Sheets.

Key Features:

Device Profiles: Select from standard OTT device profiles (e.g., Apple TV 4K, Roku 1080p, Fire TV Stick) to apply specific font-size and width constraints.

Google Drive Integration: Securely select your spreadsheet using the official Google Picker.

Automated Diagnostics: The extension reads your metadata column, calculates line wrapping based on the selected device's rendering logic, and generates a "PASS" or "FAIL" verdict.

Visual Feedback: Automatically formats the sheet with Green (Pass) and Red (Fail) indicators for immediate visual validation.

How to use:

Open a Google Sheet containing your metadata.

Open the OTT Visualizer extension.

Select the target device (e.g., "Roku (1080p)").

Enter the source column (e.g., "A") and destination column (e.g., "B").

Click "Run Diagnostic."

Privacy Note: This extension processes data directly within your browser and Google Sheets. No data is sent to external servers or third parties.
