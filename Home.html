    <h3>About the App</h3>
    <p>
        Pre-Flight Check is a professional quality assurance utility designed for Operations and Supply Chain Engineers. It eliminates costly metadata rejections by simulating how your content descriptions will render on end-user hardware before they are submitted. Stop guessing if your headlines, subtitles, or ad copy will get cut off. This extension greatly helps content creators, distributors, marketers, and operations teams to ensure their text fits perfectly on any screen before it goes live.

    <h3>How it Works</h3>
    <p>
        THE PROBLEM:

Data might look perfect in a spreadsheet, but when loaded onto a Legacy Set-Top Box, Smart TV, or Mobile App, it often gets cut off due to "Overscan," unique font metrics, or pixel density limitations. This leads to platform rejections and redelivery fees.

THE SOLUTION:

This extension utilizes a proprietary browser-based emulation engine to "draw" your metadata invisibly in memory using the exact specifications of target devices. It then stamps a PASS/FAIL verdict directly onto your Google Sheet. Simply input the column you are checking for and the target column where you want the result (Pass/Fail). This helps to understand if your descriptive metadata is too long to get rejected on multiple platforms.

KEY FEATURES:

Multi-Platform Emulation: Test against industry-standard profiles including Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, and Samsung Tizen.

Strict Mode: Specialized support for Legacy Cable Set-Top Boxes (monospaced fonts + 10% overscan).

Mobile Logic: Predicts "Read More" truncation points for Mobile and Tablet viewports.

Seamless Integration: Connects directly to your Google Sheet to flag errors in seconds.

Privacy First: All emulation happens locally. Your proprietary data is never sent to external servers.
